# webpack-performance
To date, I have attempted to integrate various tips and tricks into the Webpack build to increase performance including:

+ Splitting the vendors out into a separate bundle
+ cache= true + resolve.unsafeCache
+ happy pack plugin
+ Webpack DLL plugin
+ Common Chunks Plugin
+ cheap-module-eval-source-map

Not all of these are reflected in the code in `BuildTools/webpack.config.babel.js`, but all have been tried. As result, the buildâ€™s performance has improved drastically; however, when I change one file, several unrelated files are also rebuild, but I cannot figure out why this happening. Here are further details:


**Changing a file:**

./App/Components/Navigation/NavBar/Index.jsx


**Results in this:**

Build times range from 1-3 seconds.Note that it is actually taking time to build these files. It should not. Most of the files are completely unrelated and unaffected by the changes made in the above file. This happen when running `webpack --watch` and when running webpack as hot middleware on a node or browsersync server. 

Any ideas on how to make this stop, and instruct webpack to only change the file that actually changed?
